## Book Recommendation System - Project Overview
####  Objective: Developed a content-based Book Recommendation System that suggests similar books based on user input using book metadata and cosine similarity.

####  Dataset Used: Utilized the Book-Crossing dataset, which includes information about books, users, and ratings to build and evaluate the recommendation logic.

####  Tech Stack: Implemented using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling.

#### Recommendation Logic: Created a pivot table of user-book ratings and applied cosine similarity to identify books similar to a selected title.

####  Model Deployment: Serialized the trained recommendation model using Pickle for integration with deployment tools like Streamlit or Flask.

#### 📈 Performance Insight: Optimized recommendations by filtering top-rated books and applying similarity score thresholds to improve suggestion relevance.
