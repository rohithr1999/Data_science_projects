## Book Recommendation System - Project description
**Objective**: Developed a content-based Book Recommendation System that suggests similar books based on user input using book metadata and cosine similarity.

**Dataset Used**: Utilized the Book-Crossing dataset, which includes information about books, users, and ratings to build and evaluate the recommendation logic.

**Tech Stack**: Implemented using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling.

**Recommendation Logic**: Created a pivot table of user-book ratings and applied cosine similarity to identify books similar to a selected user ID.

**Model Deployment**: Serialized the trained recommendation model using Pickle for integration with deployment tools like Streamlit or Flask.

**Performance Insight**: Optimized recommendations by filtering top-rated books and applying similarity score thresholds to improve suggestion relevance.
